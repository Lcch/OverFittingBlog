### **About Me**

I'm Hao Chen. I'm currently a programmer at [Naturali.io](naturali.io) which is a startup in Beijing. It's about Natural Language Understanding and App Assistant. I have always been fascinated by science and technology and especially machine learning. 

Before that, I was an undergraduate at [Peking University](http://www.pku.edu.cn) majoring Computer Science. Also, I had been to [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu) as an exchange student at my fourth year of undergraduate. I've been studying algorithms for many years. I've been to [ACM-ICPC](http://icpc.baylor.edu/) World Final 2015.

This blog is to keep trace of my life and to share some technology and science knowledge. I research things I find interesting, then document it with a blog post to share my understanding. Hopefully it's able to help people to find things helpful or interesting. I welcome email and comments about all these topics, more or less.
